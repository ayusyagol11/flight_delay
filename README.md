# 🚀 Building an Interactive Flight Delay Dashboard with Dash and Plotly

## 📅 Project Overview

I recently built an interactive **Flight Delay Dashboard** using **Dash**, **Plotly**, and **Pandas**. This dashboard provides insightful visualizations of airline delays, helping users analyze trends based on different delay types: Carrier, Weather, NAS (National Aviation System), Security, and Late Aircraft delays. The dashboard allows users to select a specific year (from 2003 to 2020) and explore delay patterns for various airlines.

## 🌟 Key Features

✅ Interactive Graphs displaying average delays per month for each airline.
✅ Modern UI with a clean, structured layout (charts are aligned side by side for better comparison).
✅ Legend Section showcasing airline abbreviations and their corresponding colors.
✅ Footer Section listing full airline names and giving credit to the project.
✅ Year Selection Feature, allowing users to choose data from 2003 to 2020 to analyze trends over time.

## 🎨 About the Dashboard & Chosen Plots

The dashboard consists of five key line plots, each representing a different type of delay:

**Carrier Delay**: Delays caused by the airline’s own operations.

**Weather Delay**: Delays due to bad weather conditions.

**NAS Delay**: Delays related to air traffic control, airport congestion, and other infrastructure-related factors.

**Security Delay**: Delays caused by security-related issues (e.g., screening delays).

**Late Aircraft Delay**: Delays due to an aircraft arriving late from a previous flight.

Each of these plots helps users identify seasonal trends, airline-specific performance, and potential external factors affecting flight delays.

## 🎡 Insights & Decision Making

With this dashboard, users can:

1️⃣ Identify seasonal patterns (e.g., increased delays in winter months due to snowstorms).

2️⃣ Compare airlines' performance in handling delays.

3️⃣ Pinpoint major causes of delays and assess which delay type impacts flights the most.

Assist travelers and airlines in making data-driven decisions to improve scheduling and operations.

## 🤖 Tech Stack

**Dash**: For creating an interactive web application.

**Plotly**: For data visualization and line charts.

**Pandas**: For data manipulation and aggregation.

**Python**: The backbone of the project.

## 💪 What I Learned

1️⃣ Dash Layout Optimization: Improved my skills in structuring a Dash app, ensuring a well-organized UI.<br>
2️⃣ Data Processing with Pandas: Learned how to efficiently group and analyze airline delay data.<br>
3️⃣ Interactive Graphs with Plotly: Gained experience in creating dynamic, user-responsive charts.<br>
4️⃣ UI/UX Enhancements: Center-aligned chart titles, made them bold, and improved spacing for readability.<br>
5️⃣ Deployment & Debugging: Resolved issues like port conflicts and improved application responsiveness.<br>

## 🔗 Next Steps

1️⃣ Deploying the dashboard online for public use.

2️⃣ Adding more filters, such as selecting specific airlines.

3️⃣ Enhancing the UI further with custom themes and styling.
